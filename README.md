# Life-Expectancy-and-GDP-Project
Portfolio project including: Data Acquisition, Data Visualization, Hypothesis Testing, Summarizing Quantitative Data, Data Wrangling and Tidying, Data Manipulation with Pandas

This project was a milestone project from Codecademy where I was given no direction and presented with raw data. The project goes through Exploratory Data Analysis, hypothesis creation, and multiple visualizations to explore theories about the data presented.
